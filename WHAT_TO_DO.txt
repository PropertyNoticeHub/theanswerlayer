WHAT TO DO WITH THESE FILES
===========================

I updated 3 files for you:
1. index.html
2. about.html  
3. contact.html

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
✓ Added your Google Form email signup to index.html (styled to match the dark theme)
✓ Fixed contact.html - now has actual contact email instead of "fuck off" message
✓ NO ANALYTICS - keeping it simple

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------

STEP 1: Replace the old files
-------------------------------
In your project folder (the one ChatGPT gave you), replace these 3 files with the new versions I gave you.

STEP 2: Set up email forwarding
--------------------------------
You need to create: contact@theanswerlayer.com
Do this in GoDaddy (or wherever your domain is)
Forward it to your actual email

STEP 3: Push to GitHub
-----------------------
Once you replace those 3 files in your project folder:
- Commit the changes
- Push to GitHub
- Vercel will auto-deploy

WHERE YOUR EMAIL SIGNUPS GO:
----------------------------
Go to: https://docs.google.com/forms
Find your "TheAnswerLayer" form
Click "Responses" tab
See everyone who signed up
Export to CSV anytime you want

ABOUT THE "BROKEN" FORM IN PREVIEW:
------------------------------------
The Google Form will look broken if you open index.html locally in your browser.
THIS IS NORMAL. Google blocks local file embeds.
It WILL work perfectly fine once it's on the actual live site (theanswerlayer.com).

Don't worry about it.

THAT'S IT.
